# x402scan Transaction Visibility - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem
Transactions are executing successfully on-chain via PayAI facilitator, but **NOT appearing on x402scan.com**.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **x402scan Discovery Mechanism**: x402scan.com queries PayAI facilitator's `/discovery/resources` endpoint, but **resources must be properly registered** with metadata
2. **Transaction Indexing**: x402scan indexes transactions **by resource URL** - if the resource isn't registered, transactions won't appear
3. **Facilitator Auto-Registration**: PayAI facilitator auto-registers resources on first payment, but this may not sync to x402scan immediately

## Solution: Proper Resource Registration

### Option 1: Manual Registration on x402scan.com (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to https://www.x402scan.com/
2. Navigate to "Register Resource" or "Add Service"
3. Register each endpoint:
   ```
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/atlas-index
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/atlas-operator
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/token/create
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/mesh/register
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/x402/payment/service-payment
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/x402/payment/operator-fee
   https://api.atlas402.com/api/x402/payment/mint-fee
   ```

4. Ensure each resource includes:
   - Resource URL (exact match)
   - Merchant wallet: `0x8bee703d6214a266e245b0537085b1021e1ccaed`
   - Network: `base`
   - Asset: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` (Base USDC)
   - Facilitator: `https://facilitator.payai.network`

### Option 2: Automatic Registration via API

Use the new `/api/x402/register-resource` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.atlas402.com/api/x402/register-resource \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource": "https://api.atlas402.com/api/atlas-index",
    "name": "Atlas Index",
    "description": "Discover and test x402 services"
  }'
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Resource Registration

```bash
curl https://api.atlas402.com/api/x402/register-resource
```

Should return your registered resources.

### 2. Check PayAI Facilitator Discovery

```bash
curl https://facilitator.payai.network/discovery/resources | grep atlas402
```

Should show `api.atlas402.com` resources.

### 3. Verify Transactions on BaseScan

All simulator transactions are on-chain:
- Payment #1: `0x253ebfb0c02bebf99546b904e7f0a70f371ccf0ccb4fc8438088d1a97d318f50`
- Payment #4: `0x69979bb5f3b0974f42bc7fe938f6e846c87b02c2bbc1af6998f73e54dccf6ef2`
- Payment #6: `0x37560c5aadc85bccd584ffedc28d9feb8cc3cbc31a6bed1eac5af79a5eb8acf0`
- Payment #8: `0x38ba7d6127e5c327468aea5128b5af8e9e24e88846f0d052557c5107720e1562`
- Payment #9: `0xbd21c5dda7e9212f4a5374d52983bea8d930aec005f82ce7f1db71eb9afe5eb3`
- Payment #10: `0xd2cb58a0c82744d99712262f7713805e321c432dc3597d31ad64a275608149ec`

All transactions executed by PayAI facilitator wallet: `0xc6699d2aadA6c36Dfea5C248DD70f9CB0235cB63`

### 4. Check x402scan Server Page

After registration, check:
```
https://www.x402scan.com/server/f3c66953-18b9-46b9-84af-6f3774730036
```

Transactions should appear after:
- Resource registration: Immediate
- x402scan sync: 5-15 minutes
- Transaction indexing: 15-30 minutes

## Alternative: Switch to Coinbase Facilitator

If PayAI facilitator still doesn't work with x402scan, consider switching to Coinbase facilitator:

### Benefits:
- Coinbase facilitator may be better integrated with x402scan
- Fee-free transactions on Base network
- Official Coinbase support

### Implementation:

1. Install Coinbase x402 SDK:
```bash
npm install @coinbase/x402
```

2. Update facilitator URL:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_FACILITATOR_URL=https://facilitator.cdp.coinbase.com
```

3. Use Coinbase CDP API keys (required for mainnet)

**Note**: Coinbase facilitator URL may not be publicly accessible - verify with Coinbase docs.

## Current Status

✅ **Transactions are executing successfully** - All on-chain via PayAI facilitator  
✅ **PayAI facilitator is working** - Verifying and settling payments  
❌ **x402scan not showing transactions** - Resources likely not registered or x402scan sync delayed  

## Next Steps

1. **Manually register resources on x402scan.com** (fastest solution)
2. **Wait 24 hours** for automatic discovery sync
3. **Contact x402scan support** if still not working after registration
4. **Consider Coinbase facilitator** if PayAI integration issues persist

## Monitoring

Check simulator success rate:
```bash
curl https://api.atlas402.com/api/cron/x402scan-simulator
```

Monitor PayAI facilitator:
```bash
curl https://facilitator.payai.network/discovery/resources | jq '.items[] | select(.resource | contains("atlas402"))'
```

Check BaseScan for recent transactions:
```
https://basescan.org/address/0x8bee703d6214a266e245b0537085b1021e1ccaed
```
