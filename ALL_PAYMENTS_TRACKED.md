# All Payments Now Tracked - Complete Coverage

## âœ… What Was Missing

The **Atlas Mesh $50 registration fee** was NOT being tracked. It had its own inline payment handler in `IntegrationLayer.tsx` that bypassed our tracking system.

## âœ… What's Been Fixed

### Added Tracking to Atlas Mesh Registration
**File:** `app/components/x402/IntegrationLayer.tsx`
**Line:** ~730

When a user pays $50 to register a service, the payment is now tracked with:
- Transaction hash
- Network (Base)
- From/To addresses
- Amount (50 USDC)
- Category: `registration`
- Service name: "Atlas Mesh Service Registration"
- Metadata: Service name, endpoint, developer address

## âœ… Complete Payment Tracking Coverage

| Utility | Payment Type | Amount | Component | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Atlas Foundry** | Token Mint | Variable | `RealPaymentHandler` | âœ… Tracked |
| **Atlas Foundry** | $1 Access Fee | $1 USDC | `PaymentGateModal` | âœ… Tracked |
| **Atlas Index** | Service Access | Variable | `RealPaymentHandler` | âœ… Tracked |
| **Atlas Index** | $1 Access Fee | $1 USDC | `PaymentGateModal` | âœ… Tracked |
| **Atlas Mesh** | $50 Registration | $50 USDC | `IntegrationLayer` (inline) | âœ… **NOW TRACKED** |
| **Atlas Mesh** | $1 Access Fee | $1 USDC | `PaymentGateModal` | âœ… Tracked |
| **Atlas Operator** | $1 Protocol Fee | $1 USDC | `makeUSDCTransfer` | âœ… Tracked |

| **Solana Payments** | All Types | Variable | `PaymentGateModal` | âœ… Tracked |
